Humanity has decided to colonize a new planet. The planet, however, is not pleased with this, and has manifested itself in the form of a god, Aries, to destroy the human civilization.

This is a VR game in which you, Aries, control the environment and restore the planet to its former glory before the human invasion. The object of the game is to destroy 10 enemies. Aries has the ability to cast lightning, summon meteors, and throw boulders at the enemies residing on the planet.
